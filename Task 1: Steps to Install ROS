after downloading Ubuntu I opened the virtual Box
then I opened the terminal
I setup the sources.list by typing this command line   sudo sh -c 'echo "deb http://packages.ros.org/ros/ubuntu $(lsb_release -sc) main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros-latest.list'   in the terminal
then I set up the keys by writing   sudo apt install curl curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ros/rosdistro/master/ros.asc | sudo apt-key add -   in the terminal
before installation I had to make sure that the package is up to date by writing   sudo apt update   in the terminal
then I downlaod the Desktop-Full by writing   sudo apt install ros-melodic-desktop-full   in the terminal
then I installed the Desktop by writing   sudo apt install ros-melodic-desktop 
then I installed the ROS-Base by writing  sudo apt install ros-melodic-ros-base  
then I installed the individual package by writing this command  sudo apt install ros-melodic-PACKAGE
then checked for available packages by using this command line  apt search ros-melodic
then I started setting up the enviroment by typing this command line   echo "source /opt/ros/melodic/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc source ~/.bashrc
then I installed the rosinstall tool by using this command line   sudo apt install python-rosdep python-rosinstall python-rosinstall-generator python-wstool build-essential
then initialized rosdep by using this command line   sudo apt install python-rosdep   and   sudo rosdep init rosdep update
then lastly I typed roscore to make sure the ros was installed
